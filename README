# ASTR 302 - Final Project (Nikhil Garuda)

This project focuses on understanding how photometric redshifts can be estimated for a lensed cluster. 
We do detailed analysis on the images and do aperture corrections and PSF matching to generate SED fits to get photometric redshift estimates.
This is the tested for accuracy with the spectroscopic redshifts for several sources.

## Steps
1. Obtain images from MAST (JWST DD: 4446)
2. Fix the different pixel scales by reprojecting it to the detection filter (F444W).
3. Obtain emperical PSFs using `WebbPSF` with the images.
4. Create convolution kernels and do PSF matching to the detection filter and convolve it to each filter.
5. Use SourceExtractor to generate segmentation maps and get the raw catalogs for each filter.
6. Make the final photometry catalog using the Merlin et al. 2022 procedure with 0.66" diameters.
7. Run SED fits with `EAZYpy`.
8. Create color-color plots and color-magnitude plots for the cluster to check the dynamics of it.
9. Test the photometry catalog with the original catalog from Frye et al. 2023.
10. Make a specz-photoz plot with dispersions to find if the redshifts are accurate or not. (Still in process).
